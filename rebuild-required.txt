TypeScript changes made to:
- RiskLiquidityAdvancedOptimMerkleVerificationTestWithSign.ts

Added executeAdvancedVerificationDirect function for integrated server direct execution.

Please run: npm run build

This will compile the TypeScript changes to JavaScript so the integrated server can use the new direct execution function.
